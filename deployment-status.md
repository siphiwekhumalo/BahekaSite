- ✅ IAM role created for Lambda functions
- ✅ S3 bucket created: `bahekatechfirm.com`
- ✅ S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
- ✅ S3 public access settings configured

## ⚠️ In Progress / Needs Completion

### Lambda Function Deployment
- ⚠️ Lambda function creation encountered permission issues
- ⚠️ Need to complete API Gateway setup
- ⚠️ Need to deploy Lambda function code

### Frontend Build
- ⚠️ Frontend build process started but taking time to complete
- ⚠️ Need to deploy built files to S3 bucket

### API Gateway Setup
- ⚠️ API Gateway partially created but not fully configured
- ⚠️ Need to complete REST API endpoints setup
- ⚠️ Need to connect API Gateway to Lambda function

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Deployment

1. **Complete Lambda Function Deployment**
   - Deploy the contact form Lambda function
   - Set up proper environment variables
   - Test Lambda function execution

2. **Complete API Gateway Setup**
   - Create REST API endpoints
   - Configure CORS settings
   - Connect API Gateway to Lambda functions
   - Deploy API Gateway stage

3. **Complete Frontend Deployment**
   - Finish frontend build process
   - Deploy built files to S3 bucket
   - Configure API Gateway URL for production

4. **Test End-to-End**
   - Test contact form submission
   - Verify database storage
   - Check email notifications (if configured)

## 📊 Current Status

### Database: 100% Complete ✅
- PostgreSQL database ready
- Schema deployed
- Connection working

### Backend API: 70% Complete ⚠️
- Lambda function code ready
- Needs deployment and API Gateway setup

### Frontend: 90% Complete ⚠️
- Code ready and configured
- Build in progress
- Needs deployment to S3

### Infrastructure: 60% Complete ⚠️
- S3 bucket ready
- IAM roles created
- Needs Lambda and API Gateway completion

## 🔗 Expected Final URLs

Once deployment is complete:
- **Website**: `http://bahekatechfirm.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- **API Gateway**: `https://[api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- **Database**: Connected via environment variable

## 📋 Environment Variables Configured

- ✅ `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- ✅ `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS credentials
- ✅ `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS credentials
- ✅ `BAHEKA_EMAIL`: contact@bahekatech.com
- ⚠️ `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Not configured (optional)

The deployment is approximately 75% complete. The foundation is solid with the database working and most infrastructure in place. The remaining work involves completing the Lambda function deployment, API Gateway configuration, and frontend build deployment.
