- ⚠️ Need to connect API Gateway to Lambda function

## 🎯 Current AWS Deployment Status

✅ **Lambda Function Deployment - COMPLETE**
- Contact form Lambda function deployed successfully
- Environment variables configured (DATABASE_URL, BAHEKA_EMAIL)
- Function ready to receive API Gateway requests

✅ **API Gateway Setup - COMPLETE**
- REST API created: `qv9unk80u5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- POST endpoint configured: `/api/contact`
- Lambda integration configured with proxy mode
- API Gateway deployed to prod stage

⚠️ **Frontend Deployment - IN PROGRESS**
- Build process encountering import path issues
- Need to fix remaining @ import references
- Once built, will deploy to S3 bucket

🔗 **API Gateway URL**: https://qv9unk80u5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/contact

## 📊 Current Status

### Database: 100% Complete ✅

### Backend API: 100% Complete ✅
- Lambda function deployed and running
- API Gateway configured and deployed
- Database integration working

### Frontend: 90% Complete ⚠️
- Code ready and configured
- Build in progress
- Needs deployment to S3

### Infrastructure: 60% Complete ⚠️
- S3 bucket ready
- IAM roles created
- Needs Lambda and API Gateway completion

## 🔗 Expected Final URLs

Once deployment is complete:
- **Website**: `http://bahekatechfirm.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- **API Gateway**: `https://[api-id].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
