# Domain Setup Guide for bahekatechfirm.com

## Current Status
The domain `bahekatechfirm.com` is showing "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN" error, which means:
- Domain is not resolving to any server
- DNS records are not configured
- Or domain is not properly registered

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Option 1: Set Up DNS Records (If Domain is Registered)

1. **Check Domain Registration Status**
   ```bash
   whois bahekatechfirm.com
   ```

2. **If Domain is Registered - Configure DNS**
   - Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
   - Add these DNS records:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
   TTL: 300
   
   Type: A
   Name: www
   Value: [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
   TTL: 300
   ```

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation** (5-60 minutes)
   - Test with: `nslookup bahekatechfirm.com`

### Option 2: Use Subdomain for Testing

If the main domain isn't ready, we can use a subdomain or temporary domain:

1. **AWS Route 53 Subdomain**
   - Create: `baheka.your-aws-domain.com`
   - Point to your EC2 instance

2. **Replit Domain for Testing**
   - Deploy on Replit first
   - Get: `your-repl-name.replit.app`
   - Test all functionality

### Option 3: Use EC2 Public IP for Testing

Deploy directly to EC2 and test with IP address:
1. Launch EC2 instance
2. Get public IP (e.g., 54.123.45.67)
3. Test with: `http://54.123.45.67`
4. Configure domain later

## Domain Registration Check

Let me check if the domain is registered:
```bash
dig bahekatechfirm.com
nslookup bahekatechfirm.com
```

If the domain is not registered, you'll need to:
1. Register `bahekatechfirm.com` with a registrar
2. Configure DNS records
3. Wait for propagation

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Domain Status
- Check if domain is registered
- Verify you have access to DNS settings

### Step 2: Choose Deployment Method
- **If domain is ready**: Use EC2 deployment
- **If domain needs setup**: Use Replit deployment for testing
- **If domain issues**: Use EC2 IP for testing

### Step 3: Deploy Website
- Use the deployment scripts we created
- Test with available URL
- Configure SSL once domain is working
